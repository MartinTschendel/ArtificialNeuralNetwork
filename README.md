# ArtificialNeuralNetwork
Applying deep learning and build an artificial neural networks with tensorflow. The ANN's what make predictions on the churning probabilities of bank customers (classification) and predict the energy output of power plants (regression). The content is based on the udemy course Machine Learning A-Z.
